My assumptions
==============

  * The assignment doesn't specify which language to use - therefore I've chosen Scala version of Spark
  * I'd like to implement the `bonus` assignment - however the specification isn't clear to me. The term frequency is
    defined as the frequency of occurrence within the text file. How document frequency (frequency of occurrence within 
    the document) is different from that definition?
